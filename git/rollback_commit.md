# Rolling Back to a Previous Git Commit

## Using Git Reset
### Rolling back to a previous commit
To roll back a git commit, use `git reset` with the either the `--soft` or `--hard` flag.
* `--soft`: Does not discard the changes made, leaves them in the staging area.
* `--hard`: Discards the changes made and removes them from the staging area.
    * **NOTE**: This permanently deletes your changes. Make sure you have a backup of your work before using this flag.

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Rolls back to the previous commit, leaves changes in the staging area
```

- `git reset`: Resets the current `HEAD` to a specific commit or state.  
    - The `HEAD~1` specifies the current commit, minus one (the last commit).  
        - This can also be a commit hash.  
    - `--hard` discards the changes of the commit specified by `{commit_hash}`.
    - `--soft` will keep the changes of the commit specified by `{commit_hash}`. 
        - This leaves the changes as uncommitted changes.  

Before doing a reset, especially a hard reset, it's a good idea to ensure that 
you don't have any uncommitted changes that you want to keep.  

You can check this with `git status`.  

If you've already pushed the commit to a remote repository and you perform a 
reset, you'll have to force push (`git push --force`) to update the remote 
repository.

* Be careful with this, as it can overwrite history on the remote and can 
  impact others who have pulled the changes.

### Fast Forwarding to HEAD
If you go back to a previous commit, using `reset` or something else, use `git merge`
to get back to the HEAD of the branch. 
```bash
git merge origin/main
```
