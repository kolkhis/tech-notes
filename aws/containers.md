# Amazon Containers

What are containers?

* Lightweight, standardized packing for application code, configs, and dependencies

---

Server with Host OS, Hypervisor which managed the VMs,
each VM has a guest OS, got all the bins/libs/packages for the applications.

---

Remove the hypervisor, the need for host OS and VMs.

Package all these things together into a single container
Allows you to more densely pack the resources on a computer.
Gives a standardized package for the application to run in. 


Containers package the application as an executable essentially.  

Portable packaging mechanism that can be brought into the cloud.
Good for microservices.


* Think of it as a physical storage box.
    * Put all the stuff in the box.
    * How it does all the things is abstracted away from you.
    * Not needing to manage hypervisor or servers.
