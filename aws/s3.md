# Amazon S3

- **Amazon Simple Storage (Amazon S3)**
    - Store and retrieve any *amount* of data from anywhere.
    - Store any *type* of data.

To store data in S3, you work with resources called "buckets" and "objects."

* **Buckets**: A bucket is a container for objects.  
* **Objects**: An object is any type of file and any metadata that describes that file.  

S3 is a fully managed service. There's no need to deploy or manage servers (serverless).  

## Static Websites with Amazon S3
You can use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a static website.  
No need to manage any web servers.  

- Create a new S3 bucket to hold webpage content
    * Client-side scripts and CSS are uploaded into the bucket with an HTML file.  
    * You can configure any of your S3 buckets as a static website.  
- After uploading data into S3 bucket, you enable the static webiste hosting
  feature on the bucket

Then the static webiste should be good to go.  

- S3 buckets are automatically replicated across multiple AWS data centers
    - Any site hosted in an S3 bucket can auto-scale to handle thousands of concurrent requests
