# Packet Types  
There are a number of packets used in network transactions.  

* Data Packets: Data packets carry the actual payload.  
    * such as the content of a web page, an email message, a file, or any other data sent between devices on the network.  

* Acknowledgment Packets: Also known as ACK packets, these are used in communication 
  protocols (like TCP) to acknowledge the successful receipt of data packets.  
    * When a device receives data, it sends an acknowledgment back to the sender, ensuring reliable data transfer.  

* SYN and SYN-ACK Packets: These are specific packets used during the handshake  
  process in TCP connections.  
    * The sending device sends a SYN (Synchronize) packet to initiate a connection.  
    * The receiving device replies with a SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledgement) packet 
      to acknowledge the request and agree to establish the connection.  

* RST Packets: RST (Reset) packets are used to terminate a connection abruptly or to  
  signal an error condition during communication.  

* Request Packets: Request packets are sent by a client to request data or 
  services from a server.  
    * For example, an HTTP GET request packet is used to request a web page from a server.  

* Response Packets: Response packets are sent by a server in response to a client's request.  
    * They contain the requested data or indicate the result of the client's request.  

* ICMP Packets: Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets are used for network  
  troubleshooting and diagnostics.  
    * They are commonly used to report errors, check network connectivity, or  
      measure network performance.  

* ARP Packets: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets are used to map IP addresses  
  to MAC addresses in local networks.  
    * They help devices find each other on the same network segment.  

* DNS Packets: Domain Name System (DNS) packets are used to resolve human-readable  
  domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses, enabling communication  
  between devices on the internet.  

* Multicast Packets: Multicast packets are sent to a specific group of devices rather  
  than to a single recipient.  
    * They are used in multicast communication for efficient content distribution.  

## Martians 
Martians are little green aliens that carry packets from un-routable/impossible/invalid source addresses.
an example of a martian packet would be:
Packets with a source IP that shouldn't be routable:
- `127.0.0.1` from an external interface
- Private ranges (`192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`), showing up where only public IPs should be.  
- Reserved/bogus IPs or malformed headers.  
- Basically packets from unexpected or spoofed resources.  

Check if martians are allowed on the system via kernel settings:
```bash
sysctl -a | grep -i ipv4 | grep -i martian
```
