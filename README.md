# Notes 

This is a collection of my notes that I've taken on various tech-related things; mostly linux, vim,
scripting, and programming concepts.

These notes are published into a searchable website at
<https://kolkhis.github.io/tech-notes> using `mkdocs`.  


These are my **personal** notes that I reference day-to-day.  
They are messy and they may be incomplete. They are constantly being updated/changed.  

If you find something helpful to you, drop a star on the repo! :)
