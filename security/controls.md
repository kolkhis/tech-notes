# Security Controls

Controls can be broken down into categories and types. The types define the type of action taken.

Categories:

- Technical: Controls implemented via hardware or software (e.g., firewalls).
- Managerial: Rules or policies set by authority figures.
- Operational: Day to day processes and practices that support security (training, incident response, audits, etc.).
- Physical: Controls that protect physical access to systems.

Controls:

- Preventative: Controls that prevent incidents from occurring.
- Deterrent: Controls that discourage/deter an attacker.
- Detective: Controls that identify/detect when something goes wrong.
- Corrective: Controls that fix/restore systems after an incident occurs.
- Compensating: Alternate/fallback controls that are used when the primary
- control doesn't work.
- Directive: Controls that provide guidelines/instructions.
