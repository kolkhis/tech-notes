# STIG - Security Technical Implementation Guides

STIGs (Secure Technical Implementation Guides) are a set of security standards that 
come from DISA (the US Department of Information Systems Agency).  

STIGs are viewed with the STIG Viewer, which can be downloaded here: <https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/>



## STIG Status
Each STIG needs to be assigned a status.  

By default, there are four states a STIG can be in:
- Not Reviewed: The STIG has not yet been reviewed. 
- Open: 
- Not Applicable: The STIG does not apply in the current environment.
- Not a Finding: The STIG has been completed.
