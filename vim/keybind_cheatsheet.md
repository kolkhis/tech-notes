# Vim Keybindings, Hotkeys & Shortcuts  

Pressing `!` and then doing a motion will select the lines that the motion  
would have traversed, and put them in the Ex command line.  
E.g., `!}` at the top of a paragraph will put the whole paragraph selection  
into the Ex Command Line (for example, `:.,.+4` for a 4-line paragraph).

## Quickref
* `gf`: Go to file under cursor
* `gF`: Go to file under cursor and, if there's a number after the file name, 
        the cursor is positioned on that line in the file.
* `<C-w>gF`: Same as `gF`, but the file is opened in a new tab.  

* `gx`: Go to the filepath or URL under the cursor.
    * Uses the system default handler, by calling `vim.ui.open()`.
    * Returns (doesn't show) an error message on failure.
* `gue` will lowercase all characters from the cursor to the end of the word.
* `<C-a>`: Increment the number under the cursor.  
    * `g<C-a>` (visual): Increment the first number on each line in the selected area.  
* `<C-x>`: Decrement the number under the cursor.  
    * `g<C-x>` (visual): Decrement the first number on each line in the selected area.  
* `[I`: Show all the lines in the file that contain the word under the cursor.  
* `]m`: Go to the next braces - `{ }`

### Mapping Modes  
|  Command mode:   | Norm | Ins | Cmd | Vis | Sel | Opr | Term | Lang |
|------------------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|
| `[nore]map`      | yes  |  -  |  -  | yes | yes | yes |  -   |  -   |

| `l[nore]map`     |  -   | yes | yes |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -   | yes  |

The `l` mode (Lang / Language Argument Mode) is used when using 
an 'input method editor' (IME) for non-english characters.  


### Special Mapping Arguments  
>##### *:h map-arguments*  

```vim  
nnoremap <buffer> <leader>sa rhs  
nnoremap <nowait> <leader>sa rhs  
nnoremap <silent> <leader>sa rhs  
nnoremap <script> <leader>sa rhs  
nnoremap <expr>   <leader>sa rhs  
nnoremap <unique> <leader>sa rhs  
```
These can be used in any order.  
They must appear right after the command, before any other arguments.  


### Clearing / Deleting Mappings  
```vim  
:unmap <buffer> ,w  
:mapclear <buffer>  
```

---  

## Normal Mode  

### Insert text at the same position on the line below/above  
The `CTRL-G j` and `CTRL-G k` commands can be used 
to insert text in front of a column.  
Example: 
```c  
int i;  
int j;  
```
Position the cursor on the first `int`, type `istatic <C-G>j       `.  
The result is: 
```c  
static int i;  
       int j;  
```
To insert the same text in front of the column in every line,
use the Visual blockwise command `I`.   
`:h v_b_I`.  


Using `CTRL-G u` splits undo: the text typed before and after it is undone separately.  
Using `CTRL-O` does the same thing after performing an action.  

### Toggling Case  
* `gUgU` / `gUU`: Make current line uppercase.  
* `gugu` / `guu`: Make current line lowercase.  
* `gU{motion}`: Make the text selected with `{MOTION}` uppercase  
* `gu{motion}`: Make the text selected with `{MOTION}` lowercase  

* `g?{MOTION}`: Rot13 encode/decode text selected by `{MOTION}`.  


### Editing Motions  
* `d/word`: Delete text up to a searched pattern  
* `d?word`: same as above, except deletes backwards to search term  

* `c/word`: Remove text up to a searched pattern and go into insert mode  
* `c?word`: same as above, except changes backwards to search term  

* `y/word`: Yank text up to a searched pattern  
* `y?word`: same as above, except yanks backwards to search term  

* `vib`: Go into visual mode and select inside parens (` ( ) `)  
* `viB`:  Go into visual mode and select inside braces (` { } `)  

* `ge`/`gE`: Go to the end of the previous `word` / `WORD` respectively.  

* `gv`: Select last visual selection.  

* `J`: Join the line below with the current line.  
* `gJ`: Like `J` but don't add a space between the joined lines.  

### Macros  
* `qa`: Start recording macro into register `a` (where `a` is any letter).  
    * `qA`: Start *appending* to the macro in register `a`.  
* `@a`: Execute macro in register `a`.  
* `Q`: Repeat last *recorded* macro.  
* `@@`: Repeat last *executed* macro.  


### Swapping Lines, Chars, and Words  
* `deep`: exchange two words (start with the cursor in the blank space before the first word).  
    * `dawelp`: Does the same thing but you can be anywhere inside the first word.  

### Windows  

* `<C-w><C-q>`: Close the current window.  
* `<C-w>hjkl`: Move to the window in the corresponding direction  
* `<C-w>r`: Rotate the position of the windows  


---  


## Insert Mode  

* `CTRL-T`: Indent the current line  
* `CTRL-D`: Unindent the current line  
* `CTRL-W`: Delete the previous word  
* `CTRL-U`: Delete all the text entered on the current line  
    * Deletes text only inserted since you went into insert mode.  
    * If you didn't enter any text, it deletes the whole line.  
* `CTRL-Y`: Insert the character **above** the cursor.  


### Insert Mode Completion  
* `CTRL-X {mode}`: enter `CTRL-X` sub mode (omni-completion)  
    * `i_CTRL-X_index`
* `CTRL-N`: Pick the first available completion from the current buffer.

## Select mode  
In Select mode, vim behaves more like a standard graphical editor.  
The same keybindings for motion you would use in a non-vim-enabled  
environment are applicable in Select mode.  

Entering select mode:  
* From Normal mode with:  
    * `gh` for character-wise selection  
    * `gH` for line-wise selection  
    * `g^H` for block-wise selection  
* From Insert mode with:  
    * `<C-o>` followed by one of the above commands.  
* From Visual mode with `<C-g>` (`v_CTRL-G`)  
    * `<C-g>` Toggles between Visual and Select  

The main movement keys for Select Mode are the same as other editors:  
* Cursor Keys  
    * `<Up>`
    * `<Down>`
    * `<Left>`
    * `<Right>`
* Nav Keys  
    * `<Home>`
    * `<End>`
    * `<PageUp>`
    * `<PageDown>`

### Commands in Select mode:  
* Non-movement characters (without `<C-char>`) delete the selection.  
    * The typed character is inserted.  
* Non-printable movement commands, with the Shift key pressed, extend the  
  selection.  
    * `keymodel` must include `startsel`.  
* Non-printable movement commands, with the Shift key NOT pressed,
  stop Select mode.  
    * `keymodel` must include `stopsel`.  
    * Otherwise, extends selection.  
* ESC stops Select mode.  
* `CTRL-O` switches to Visual mode for the duration of one command.  
* `CTRL-G` switches to Visual mode.  
* `CTRL-R` {register} selects the register to be used for the text that is  
  deleted when typing text.  
    * Unless you specify the `_` (black hole) register, the unnamed register is  
      also overwritten.

## Netrw  

### View / Opening Files  
* `i`: Cycle through the different listing styles.  
* `o`: Opens file under cursor in horizontal split.  
* `v`: Opens file under cursor in vertical split.  
* `t`: Opens file under cursor in a new tab.  
* `gx`: Open file with an external program  
    * This can be disabled by setting the `g:netrw_nogx` variable.  

### Browsing  
Changing the current directory (or working directory):  
* `gn`: Change the "tree top" to the word below cursor (see `:Ntree`)  
* `u`/`U`: Jump to previous/next directory in browsing history.  
    * Change `g:netrw_dirhistmax` to increase the amount of directories saved. (default 10)  
* `-`: Go up a directory (`../`)  

### Modifying Files  
* `D`: Delete marked files/directories (and empty directories). 
       If no files are marked, delete the file/directory under the cursor.  
    * Delete files matching a pattern: `:MF pattern`, then `D`
* `gp`: Ask for new permission for the file under cursor.  
    * Uses `g:netrw_chgperm`. Default: `chmod PERM FILENAME` 
      (Windows: `cacls FILENAME /e /p PERM`)  
* `X`: When pressed when cursor is above an executable, it will prompt the  
       user for arguments. Netrw will call `system()` with that cmd and args.  

### Bookmarks

    * Stored in `.netrwbook` (in the `g:netrw_home` directory).  
* `mB`: Remove the currently browsed directory from bookmarks.  
* `qb`: List bookmarks and history  
* `{cnt}gb`: Go to `{cnt}` bookmark.  
* Also available: `:NetrwMB[!] [files/directories]`
    * No Argument (and in netrw buffer):  
        * Adds marked files to bookmarks.  
        * Else, adds file/directory under cursor.  
    * With arguments: `glob()` each arg and bookmark them.  
    * With bang (`!`): Removes files/directories from bookmarks.  

### File Display / Information  
* `qf`: Get file's size and last modification timestamp.  
* `S`: Specify priority via sorting sequence (`g:netrw_sort_sequence`).  
* `gh`: Toggle between hiding the "dotfiles" and not.  
* `a`: Toggle through three hiding modes. Set the hiding list with `<C-h>`
* `<Ctrl-H>`: Brings up a requestor allowing user to change the 
  file/directory hiding list in `g:netrw_list_hide`.
