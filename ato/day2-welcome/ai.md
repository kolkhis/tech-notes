# From Experiment to Enterprise
## How Block Operationalized MCP at Scale
### Angie Jones

Started with one idea -- a dev agent that could do things more than just
generate code snippets.  

LLMs introduced function calling. This was hard to scale, though. Anthropic
started working on MCP 


MCP - stadnard that allows agents to connect to various sources.  
goose is an extensible MCP client. It was succesful internally. Many of their
internal engineers found they saved 8-10 hrs per week. Become widely adopted
with engagement spiking by 50% weekly.  

Goose Open Sourcing was well received. It was training on GH and Twitter.

They wanted a general purpose agent. Not just a developer agent. Something that
anyone could use.  


## Making a Name for Yourself

### What do next?

- find online communities to get plugged into: `torc.dev` and next play

- look into ai jobs boards
 
- go to some dang networking events

- find a mentor

---

Use x: follow founders and ai engineers and engage with them daily
start learning in public. you have to be known as 'the person' in your circles.
create smth or help someone else create something. everyone is starting from
zero.. 
look at job descriptions.

## Getting Future Contributors (In the Age of AI)

Built OpenSauce. Way to manage open source contributions.  

OpenSauced joined the Linux Foundation (last year/2024).  

> "Today, 46% of code is generated (AI)" - github

Open source projects are getting AI contributions.
Some people may allow AI contribs but divulge that you did.  

### Who's maintaining the generated code??

- Continue - Continous AI (Company)
    - github/continuedev/continue
- amplified.dev
- (netlify)
### Contribution Distribution
- oss.fyi/continue
This shows who repeatedly come back for more, and shows who contributes to
projects.  

many PRs per day, tons of contributions  

Workspaces -- take issues/discussions that are open, find similar ones that are
open.  

Issues are 

> Issues are just the beginning of the story. 

Stars aren't the best metric for popularity. Issue authors is the best metric
for determining how well a project is doing.  

- PRs are stories we leave for future maintainers. 
- Use PR descriptions!!!

When a PR or issue is opened, people read it.  

- Every single person who opened an issue or opened a PR is a seed for a future
  maintainer.  

- Code review is more important than ever in the age of AI.  

- Go through all previous issues, PRs, etc. when you want to contribute to a
  project.
