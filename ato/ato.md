# All Things Open (2025)
## Raleigh, NC

All Things Open is a tech conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.  

All Things Open (ATO) is one of the largest open-source technology conferences 
in the U.S., bringing together thousands of developers, engineers, and open-
source advocates each year in Raleigh, North Carolina.

It's held annually at the Raleigh Convention Center, a spacious venue designed to 
host an event of this size.   

2025 marks the 13th anniversary of ATO, with upwards of six thousand attendees this year!  


## Speakers

Industry professionals from all over the world are invited to speak on
topics on which they're considered experts.

There are several points of focus, and as such, the organizers have presented
thematic "tracks" that attendees can focus on. Tracks aren't fixed, the attendees 
can freely attend any session, but they help guide people towards talks that
fit their interests or roles.  

There are several tracks including ones for developers, infrastructure
engineers, database administrators, and AI/ML focused professionals, to name a
few.

Many of the speakers that are presenting are long-time industry professionals
from big-name companies and projects (e.g., GitHub, Tailscale, AlmaLinux, etc.), as
well as some popular content creators. Some of the talks are highly technical,
while others focus on the broader aspects of working in tech as a whole.  

Wherever you may find yourself in tech, there is a topic being presented that
will be suited to your role.  


## Booths

Vendors from across the open-source and tech world filled the conference hall
with booths, demos, and "swag" giveaways. RedHat was giving away -- 
and this may shock you -- red Fedoras! CIQ represented Rocky Linux, Warewulf, 
and other projects with lanyards, tote bags, stickers, and even temporary tattoos. 
One booth was even giving away specially-branded Tide pens! Every booth was 
giving away stickers for their products.  I think I walked out of the 
convention center with one of every sticker that was ever created.

Now, swag aside, this is a great marketplace for exploring solutions that you 
may want to try out yourself, or perhaps you'll find a solution that you can 
find a use for professionally. It's essentially an open marketplace of ideas, 
technologies, and knowledge.

For instance, some folks from Tailscale were at the event with a booth and
speakers. Tailscale offers homelabbers (among others) a solution to remotely 
connect to their homelab server in a **secure** way, without manually exposing 
ports and going through the trouble of setting up proper security measures to 
prevent connections from malicious actors. There is, of course, a paid tier for
businesses that want a highly scalable solution for corporate needs as well,
but this one stuck out to me as an avid homelabber.  

That's just one example of many cool tools and technologies being represented.  

Some other notable booths and demos included:

- AWS Open Source was being represented
- Zabbix, DynaTrace, Observe, DataDog, and plenty other observability solutions were on
  display  
- HeroDevs had one of the craziest booths at the event.
- The Linux Foundation was there giving away discounts for educational content
- Intuit (the people behind Argo) were demoing their new project, numaflow
- CodeRabbit was demoing an agentic AI code reviewer
- Keebio had a great booth set up to display their newest ergonomic mechanical keyboards.

There many other new cutting-edge AI products were on display by a variety of companies.

Now, it's not just corporate entities being represented. The event is called
"All Things Open," so, as you can imagine, there was a **heavy** Open-Source
presence.  

Alma Linux had a booth set up and made a strong case as a leading open-source,
binary-compatible RHEL alternative.  

There were some Raleigh locals there, some representing the TriLUG (Triangle Linux User
Group), as well as some other local businesses that were in attendance.  

There were several recruitment agencies that set up booths throughout the center.  
If you're looking for work, there are people who can help you to determine your best fit 
and help to place you in a position.

I can't list all of the great booths and all the cool things that they were presenting
in one writeup while doing them all justice. If any of these things sound
interesting to you, you should consider attending next year!

## Community

The community is incredibly welcoming. This was my first ever tech conference,
and the welcome I received from the other attendees, volunteers, and speakers 
was nothing short of amazing. 

Everyone, and I mean everyone (attendees, volunteers, and speakers) are all passionate about 
technology. People are there because they care. The community is the beating heart
of open source, and it's beating strong.  

## Things I Learned

All the different talks I attended had something valuable to offer.  

- CI/CD Tips: Various deployment strategies  
- Commit Spoofing with Git Commit Metadata: **Incredibly** valuable to be aware of as
  an open-source maintainer  
- Linux Tips and Tricks: A collection of miscellaneous Linux tips presented by
  engineers and content creators  
- Remotely Connecting to a Homelab: Using Tailscale to set up **secure**
  ingress into my homelab (or any other device)  

It was not just technical topics that I learned about either. Some of the most
valuable things I learned were non-technical.  

- How to get involved with open-source projects
- How tech professionals network
- How to be a non-code-contributing member of a community
- ...among other things.

## Summary

All Things Open is a great opportunity to network, learn, pick up new
technologies, hear from industry leaders about the trajectory of future tech, 
and support the projects that you love.

Even if you can't attend the official ATO conference, I'd highly recommend
hitting up one of the free co-located events that are held the day prior.  

These free events are:

- Community Leadership Summit
- Open Source Accessibility Summit
- Inclusion and Diversity Summit

I attended the Community Leadership Summit, which was an amazing time with
great discussions (but that's a separate writeup).
