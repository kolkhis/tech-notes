# Issues
Sitting in the back it's very hard to hear the speakers, as two different
sessions are occurring in the same room. 

---

Issue: People contributing for the sake of getting a certification.

Acknowledge the first contribution as a big milestone but not a certifiable
accomplishment.

## Project idea

Separate utility for potential contributors to put their PR up in, and link to
the repo, and have the AI give code review as a reviewer.

- Check contribution guidelines
- Check style guide
- Respect
    - The automatic response can maybe come off as "your time isn't worth my time"
    - The automatic response could be less intimidating for potential contributors
