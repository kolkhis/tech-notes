ParticipatingBeing a member of a community.

But there are communities that we *want* to be a part of, but how do we do it?

As you find a group, find your niche.

Understand the pain points of orgs that are tied into each other. 
Find which groups are connected to which, choose accordingly.  

Red tape for connecting one org w/ another: May ask for proprietary information
that can't be given. Bridge gently then bring in the expert that *can* answer
this in the correct way.  


## Idea
Connect orgs to universities  
Connects students to Org via platoform  

## Lookup
