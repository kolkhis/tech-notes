# Domain Name Configuration

Configurating a domain name for a website (e.g., a GitHub Pages website) requires
setting up DNS records.  


---

To set up a domain name for a GitHub Pages website: 

1. Create a CNAME file in the GitHub repo (root of repo).  
    - Put the domain name in this file.  
      ```plaintext
      kolkhis.dev
      ```
    - It can be a sub-domain as well.  
      ```plaintext
      docs.kolkhis.dev
      ```
    - Push it to GH.  

2. Update DNS settings in your domain name provider.  
    - Go to your domain and find "Records."
