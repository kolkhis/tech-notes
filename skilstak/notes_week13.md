### Grok Internet Networking
* Ethernet
    * Routing
        * Local Area Network (LAN)
        * Wide Area Network  (WAN)
        * Ethernet Address (machine address)
        * Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP)
    * Ports
    * Network Address Translation (NAT)
* IP
* TCP/IP
* UDP
* Domain Names
    * Discovery
        * `whois`
        * <https://shodan.io>
    * Registrars
    * localhost 127.0.0.1
    * Reserved
    * `/etc/hosts`
* HTTP/HTTPS
* TLS
* SSH (Secure Shell)
    * `~/.ssh/config`
* Beware of legacy: FTP, Telnet, Gopher

### Common Network Query Commands
* `dig`, `nslookup`,
* `ifconfig`, `ipconfig`, `ip`, `ss`
* `ping`
* `nmap`



Telnet is SSH without encryption



### Shodan

shodan.io <- Shows a bunch of vulnerabilities


### Bits vs Bytes
Megabit != Megabyte
1 byte = 8 bits
Mbps is megabits per second


#### Ethernet

Ethernet can be thought of as mail
It's happening at the speed of light (literally uses light)

Info is transferred through packets 

Mail metaphor:
You put a letter into the envelope (package), 
The envelope has the final destination on it, and a return address.

This is exactly the same for packets.

All those letters would be pre-sorted by zip-code 
In a mail room, all the letters would be dropped off at the post office.(this is the network router)

### Tools
#### Looking Out
`tracepath` <- Will trace alll the differe "post offices" between the user and the endpoint
(Windows has `pathping`, similar)
`traceroute` 
`mtr` <- My Trace Route (sudo apt-get install mtr)
`ping` <- sends ICMP packet to target, counts how long it takes
    packet sniffers <- LOOK IT UP

mtr sends out a specific type of packet (ICMP)

#### Looking In (incoming traffic)
`netstat`  (sudo apt-get install net-tools)
OR `ss` - `sudo ss -ltp`
    `$ netstat -tuna`
    `$ netstat -p`
    `$ netstst -tpua`
    `$ netstat -peanut`
    state:
        established = There is an open connection
        listen = it's listening, no active connection

`lsof` was used before netstat

from address    to address

if the from address is your IP, it's going out

Find the default port for telnet: (or anything else)
grep telnet /etc/services

`nmap` <- 

`ncat`/`nc` <- Make your own servers that do whatever you want if you can get
                ncat on the system
`strace -p` <- sniff the communications of a particular process
`ufw status verbose` <- firewall


## Display all inbound attack vectors
`netstat -tua | grep LISTEN`

If you can't answer the question "Why is this running?" maybe you've been hacked.
Hackers will commonly trojan the netstat command to hide themselves
Goes in /proc

ipp (internet printing protocol) is one that will be susceptible to hacks

### Hardening
A big part of hardening is disabling services that don't need to be running.

This can be also used to find exploits.
See what stuff is running that they're not keeping track of.


`ifconfig`/`ip a` (ipconfig on windows)


`namecheap.com` check for domains






Netword Admins/engineers get paid a lot.
Cisco Certifications 



A packet will go through many points before it reaches the endpoint

\_gateway is the first hop
    This is the router
then it goes to ISP
Then it goes to netops.charter (or other packet distribution centers)
    This is the backbone of internet


Ethernet address (machine address/ Mac Address) changes as it goes
link/ether <- Specifies the mac address. They use the same format as ipv6
This can be changed (lol)

The IP endpoint does not change


Every time the packet changes hands,
the next hop address gets crossed-out and a different stamp goes on it.
This has a direct correlation to TCPIP

ipv4 = 32bit
ipv6 = 128bit



DHCP - When your device comes onto the network it is assigned a dynamic
* Points at something that might move.
* Everyone on the LAN sees the packet that is sent when a device connects
* contains the hardware address
* NIC card - Network Interface Controller
* The response comes from someone claiming to be the router.
    * Keeps track of the traffic on the network for that mac address.
* Dynamic unless Reserved

#### Domain Hijacking

#### Ethernet Spoofing
Spoofing a mac address

A MITM attack intercepts traffic and forwards it to its destination,
writes all the packets to a log file and brute force attacks the packets offline.
#### Packet Storm


## Ports

In french, port means "door"
A port is a doorway to a *specific service*
Responses, the router or service create ephemeral ports - imaginary port that doesn't block incoming traffic

### Reserved ports
`$ less /etc/services`

Best way to hide a hack is to listen on a different port, pretending to be something else
port 80 (http)
port 443 (https) 443/tcp 443/udp
port 8080


`netstat`, `nmap`




## Network Layers

## 7 Layers of the OSI Model
physical - coax, fiber, wireless, hubs, repeaters
data link - Ethernet, PPP, switch ,bridge
Network - packets - ip, ivmp, ipsec, igmp
Transport 0 E2E connections - tcp, udp

`ping google.com` <- ttl=ping/latency


Transport layer: UDP or TCP/IP

UDP packet delivery is not guranteed but are being sent en masse
TCP/IP packets are required to be received

TCP/IP is WAY slower then UDP

Web apps/email, you'd want to use TCP/IP
Games/streaming, you want to use UDP





Reserved IPs
127.\*.\*.\*
192.168.\*.\*



## Discovery
`whois` shows a bunch of information about the associated domain
    whois skilstak.io
    the name servers can also be then used in whois

`dig` will show the IPs associated with a name
    dig skilstak.io

`nslookup`


/etc/hosts - edit and add a name to the end of a host if you want an alias
This is machine-local
Can also add an entry to .ssh/config, but this only applies to ssh




## Firewall
Requires 2 connections to the network
One side, it connects to the home network
Other side, it connects to the internet

It just blocks things.
A firewall is a safe way to control access to your home network.
Additionally, you can block outgoing stuff too.

Firewall rules going out are usually very permissive
Malware installed on a system, the first thing it'll usually do is "phone home"
