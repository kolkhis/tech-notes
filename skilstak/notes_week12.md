## Off-topic notes
### "Progressive Web Design (PWA)"  
Works for all users regardless of their browser choice.  
- Important for blind users.


### Transferring Files

Never use FTP, only SFTP
dev.to BLOCKS TEXT BROWSERS LOL


`wget` good for copying lots of things
`curl` is what you're gonna use a lot


### vi mode for terminal:  
`set -o vi`  
Then you can search bash history with:  
/<search_term> (in normal mode, NOT insert mode.)  
Then `n` for next, `N` for previous.  

### Security tip: arguments passed 

Arguments passed on the cmdline can be seen by anyone on the system


### Making Custom Binaries (executables)
~/.local/bin 
> Path for custom executables.


### CLI Tools to Become Familiar With
* xclip
* npv/nvp # sound clips, pulse audio
* ESXi
* Ncdu
* pandoc
* ffmpeg

### Some Bash Tips
`exec` is the preferred way to hand off the current shell to another process.  

`exec bash -l`
> This will reload shell (for .bashrc etc reloads)
> The `-l` makes bash act like a login shell.

### Untar file
Download the file
`curl -LO (tarfile link)` 
#### check file (check that it isn't a tarbomb)
`tar tvf (tarfile)`

#### Then untar (unzip) the file. 

tar zxvf (tarfile)
