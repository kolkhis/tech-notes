# My Personal Tech Notes
... published into a static site for your convenience.  

---

Ever since I started down the Linux rabbit hole, I started writing all my notes in
Markdown using Vim.  

Due to using markdown, I was able to use `mkdocs` to turn them into a searchable web
page. Personally, I just use `grep` to find what I need, but I understand that a web
browser is easier for some people.  

So here we are! I've accumulated knowledge on various topics and put that knowledge
into words that now exist on the internet.  

Use these words as you see fit. Share them if you want. It's the internet. Do what you want.  

## Build

This site was built with `mkdocs`. The build process is automated using GitHub
Actions, and the `mkdocs.yml` file (which determines the layout of the website) is 
procedurally generated using a Bash script. I did it this way so that the website would
automatically update each time I add a new file or delete/rename an existing one.  


## Disclaimer

These are my **personal** notes that **I** reference on a day-to-day basis.  
They are messy.  
They may be incomplete.  
They are constantly being updated and changed.
