# Linux Commands for Kernel and Packages

## Overview

You are a new system administrator at a company.
You've been tasked with finding out information about a set of servers that has very little to no documentation on it.

1. Check kernel and package info on the system.

2. Echo the number of kernel versions that are stored on this system into /root/kernel.

3. Find specific versions of the software that the security team has been asking about, specifically ssh server and client.

```bash
uname -a
