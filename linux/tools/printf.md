# `printf`

The `printf` builtin is a way to output text to the terminal.  

It's an alternative to `echo`.  

## Why `printf`?

This is one of those things that people debate over which one to use. I use `printf`
almost exclusively now, as it is much more feature-rich and portable than `echo`.

On different shells you will see different versions of `echo`, but `printf` is 
usually static in its functionality across all shells.  

Furthermore, it matches `printf` in other languages (e.g., C), so it's a much more 
portable knowledge set than using `echo`.
