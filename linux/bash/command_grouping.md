# Command Grouping - Using Curly Braces `{ ... }` to Group Commands 


The syntax `{ }` in Bash is used for command grouping.  
 
The `{ }` command grouping syntax is POSIX-compliant.  
 

Command grouping behavior is similar to subshells `( )`.
Command groups execute a series of commands as a single unit, just
like subshells.  

However, command groups are very different in that they are executed
in the current shell context.  

This means that any changes made to the environment persist 
after the command group ends.  
 
This includes:

* Variable declarations and assignments.  
* `cd`: Changes the current working directory.
* `set`: Changes to shell options.


## Explanation of Command Grouping  

Commands inside curly braces `{ ... }` are executed in the current 
shell context, and they are considered a single unit by the shell.  

Redirections, pipes, or logical operators (like `&&` and `||`) outside  
the braces apply to all commands inside the braces.  


## Examples and Use Cases

### Combining Multiple Commands for a Single Redirection  
 
Redirect the output of multiple commands to the same file:  
```bash  
{ date; printf "Hello, World!\n"; } > output.txt  
```
This will put the following into `output.txt`:  
```plaintext  
Sat Feb  3 16:12:33 EST 2024  
Hello, World!  
```

This can be useful for generating reports:  
```bash  
{ 
  printf "Header Info\n";  
  date;  
  printf "Footer Info\n";  
} > report.txt  
```
This will put the following into `report.txt`:  
```plaintext  
Header Info  
Sat Feb  3 16:16:09 EST 2024  
Footer Info  
```

### Error Handling with Atomic Operations  
 
Command grouping executes a series of commands as a single unit.  
If any command fails, the entire group is aborted:  
```bash
{
  command1 && command2 && command3;
} || {
  echo "An error occurred." >&2;
}
```

Note: The `>&2` redirection operator is used to redirect the stderr output stream.  
 
So, when you see `echo "Error encountered during execution." >&2`, it means
"echo the error message to standard error instead of standard output."  
 
```bash
{
  command1 && command2;
} || {
  printf "Error encountered during execution.\n" >&2;
  exit 1;
}
```

### Creating Complex Pipelines
 
Use command grouping to create complex pipelines, where the output
of multiple commands is piped into another command:
```bash
{
  echo "First part";
  echo "Second part";
} | grep "First"
```
This searches through the combined output of the two `echo` commands.


---


### Conditionals 
 
Execute a group of commands only if a certain file exists:
```bash
[[ -f "config.cfg" ]] && {
  printf "Loading configuration...\n";
  source config.cfg;
  printf "Configuration loaded.\n";
}
```


---


### Cleanup Operations
 
Perform cleanup operations in a grouped manner, ensuring that
all cleanup steps are taken together:
```bash
{
  rm -f temp1.txt;
  rm -f temp2.txt;
  printf "Temporary files removed.\n";
} >> cleanup.log
```

## Limitations:  

* Commands inside `{ ... }` must be separated by semicolons  
  or newlines. 

* There must be a space or newline after the opening `{` and a space  
  or newline before the closing `}`.  

* Grouping `{ ... }` executes commands in the current shell context. 
    * Any changes to the environment (`cd`, `set`, etc.) persist  
      after the command group completes.  
        * **Variable assignments do persist after the command group completes**.
    * This is different from using subshells `( ... )`, where  
      changes are local to the subshell.
