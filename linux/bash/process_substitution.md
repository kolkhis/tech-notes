## Process Substitution in Bash  
Process substitution is for treating command outputs as files.  
  
This is useful for using commands instead of files, where only  
files are accepted.  


## Overview  

* Process substitution is used to treat the output of a process  
  as a filename, which can then be passed to other commands.  
* This feature is available in Bash and other shells that support it, like Zsh.  


## Syntax  

* `<(list)`: This form is used when you want to treat the output  
  of `list` as an input file.  
    * For example, `cat <(ls)` will execute `ls` and then `cat` the output  
      as if it were a file.  
* `>(list)`: This form is for treating the input to the process as an output file.  
    * For example, `echo "Hello" > >(cat)` will pass "Hello" to `cat` as its input.  


## How It Works  

* Bash replaces each `>(list)` and `<(list)` with a filename.  
    * This filename points to a FIFO (named pipe), or a file 
      in `/dev/fd` that is connected to standard input (stdin) or  
      output of the `list` process.  
* The `list` process is executed asynchronously, meaning the 
  main command and `list` can run at the same time.  


## Examples  
 
1. Comparing Two Dynamic Sets of Data  
    ```bash  
    diff <(ls dir1) <(ls dir2)  
    ```
    * This command compares the output of `ls` in two different directories.  

2. Passing Dynamic Input to a Command  
    ```bash  
    cat > >(grep "pattern")  
    ```
    * This sets up a `grep` process that will receive input from `cat`.  

`<(list)` and `>(list)` can be used in any context where a filename is expected.  
For example, you can use them in a loop.  

```bash  
# Using <(list)  
wc -l < <(for i in {1..5}; do printf "asdf: %d\n" "$i"; done;)  
# output: 5  
wc -l <(for i in {1..5}; do printf "asdf: %d\n" "$i"; done;)  
# output: 5 /dev/fd/63

file <(for i in {1..5}; do printf "asdf: %d\n" "$i"; done;)  
# outputs: /dev/fd/63: symbolic link to pipe:[16626856]  


# Using >(list)  
for i in {1..5}; do printf "asdf: %d\n" "$i"; done > >(wc -l)  
# output:  
# 5  

for i in {1..5}; do printf "asdf: %d\n" "$i"; done; >(wc -l)  
# output:  
# asdf: 1  
# asdf: 2
# asdf: 3
# asdf: 4  
# asdf: 5  
# -bash: /dev/fd/63: Permission denied  

file >(wc -l)  
/dev/fd/63: symbolic link to pipe:[16644073]  
0  

```

Or, for `>(list)`, you can use it to write the output of a command to a file.  
```bash  
echo "Hello" > >(cat)  
```


### Process Substitution Mechanism  
 
When you use process substitution in Bash with `>(list)` or `<(list)`, Bash  
does something quite clever:  

1.  Creates a Pipe or File Descriptor  
    * For both `>(list)` and `<(list)`, Bash sets up a special kind of file known 
      as a FIFO (First In, First Out) named pipe, or it uses a file descriptor 
      in `/dev/fd`.  
    * A pipe is like a temporary file that acts as a buffer for data between processes.  

2.  Substitutes with a Filename  
    * Bash then replaces the `>(list)` or `<(list)` expression in your command 
      with a filename.  
        * This filename is not a regular file but a reference to the pipe or  
          file descriptor it created.  
    * This allows the rest of your command to interact with this filename as if 
      it was a regular file.  

3.  Connects to the Process (`list`)  
    * The created pipe or file descriptor is connected to the standard 
      input (stdin) or output (stdout) of the process you specified in `list`.  
    * For `>(list)`, the pipe/file descriptor is connected to the stdin of `list`.  
    * For `<(list)`, it's connected to the stdout of `list`.  



## Process Substitution Examples  

## Examples of Using a Command as an Input File `<(list)`
You have a command that generates some data, and you want  
to pass this data, as a *file*, to another command as input.  

### Comparing the Contents of Two Directories  
```bash  
diff <(ls dir1) <(ls dir2)  
```

1. Bash executes `ls dir1` and `ls dir2` and directs their outputs  
   to two pipes (or file descriptors).  
2. It then replaces `<(ls dir1)` and `<(ls dir2)` with filenames that  
   represent these pipes.  
3. `diff` then reads from these filenames as if they were regular files  
   containing the output of the `ls` commands.  

* Merging Two Files Side-by-Side  
```bash  
paste -d "\n" <(cat file1.txt) <(cat file2.txt) > merged.txt  
```

1. Combines `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` side-by-side into `merged.txt`.  
    * This is useful for comparing or merging files line by line.  

### Filtering Log Files  
```bash  
grep ERROR <(zcat /var/log/app.log.gz)  
```

1. If you have compressed log files (like `.gz` files), this command lets  
   you grep them directly without manual decompression.  
    * `zcat` is identical to `gunzip -c`
    * `zcat` uncompresses either a list of files on the command line or its  
      standard input and writes the uncompressed data on standard output.  



## Examples of Using a Command as an Output File `<(list)`
 
`>(list)` is used to direct the output of a command into another  
command as its input.  
This treats the output of the first command as a file, rather than  
the command inside the parentheses.  

You have a command that generates some data, and you want  
to pass this data directly to another command for further 
handling.  


### Transforming a String to All Caps  
 
```bash  
echo "Hello, world" > >(tr 'a-z' 'A-Z')  
```
 
* Here, `echo "Hello, world"` generates a string.  
* `>(tr 'a-z' 'A-Z')` sets up a process substitution.  
* The output of `echo`, which is `"Hello, world"`, is directed to  
  the `tr` command (translate command) 
* This uses the named pipe or file descriptor created by `>(...)` to pass 
  the input to `tr`.  
* `tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'` then converts this input to uppercase.  
* The final output will be "HELLO, WORLD".  


### Logging and Displaying Output  
 
```bash  
printf "Application started at: %s\n" "$(date)" | tee >(logger -t myapp)  
```

* This command writes a log message to both the standard output and the system logger.  
  It's useful for logging and monitoring.  
    * `logger` is a command that writes to the system log.  
    * The system log can be accessed using the `journalctl` command.  
        * i.e.,
          ```bash  
          journalctl -t myapp  
          ```

### Real-time Processing of Command Output  
 
```bash  
cat /var/log/syslog | grep --line-buffered "CRON" > >(notify-send -t 10000 "Cron Alert")  
```

* This command monitors the syslog for CRON entries 
  and sends desktop notifications in real-time for each match.  
* Great for real-time monitoring of logs.  


### Transcoding a Video File  
 
```bash  
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 >(x264 -o output.mkv -)  
```

* In this example, `ffmpeg` reads a video file and pipes the output 
  to `x264` for transcoding.  


---

## In Plain English  
 
* `<(list)`
    * Think of this as creating a temporary file that contains the output of `list`.  
    * Your command then reads from this temporary file.  
* `>(list)`
    * Imagine this as directing the output of your *last* command into a temporary file, 
      which is then used as input for `list`.  



## Limitations  
 
* Portability  
    * Process substitution is not POSIX-compliant, so it might  
      not work in all Unix-like shells.  
    * It's primarily supported in Bash and Zsh.  
* Filesystem Support  
    * It requires support for named pipes (FIFOs) or `/dev/fd`.  
* Read or Write, Not Both  
    * Each instance of process substitution can be used either for reading or 
      writing, but not both simultaneously.
