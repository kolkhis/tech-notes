### Tmux vs Screen
#### Multiple user session:
* Both have multi-user support
* Screen allows users to share a session *and* be in different windows.
    * screen -r sessionowner/[pid.tty.host]
* Tmux session allows users to share a session, but switching windows switches for both users.

* Attach to existing session in tmux:
    * `tmux attach -t [session_name]`
    * Where `[session_name]` is the target session from `tmux ls`

* Attach to an existing `screen` session:
    * `screen -r` or `screen -R [session_name]`




### Cool Vim Tips/Tricks

Registers:

* `"tyy` <- yank line to register t  
* `@t` <- play register as macro  

Macros:

* `q[char]` <- start recording a macro in the [char] register. q again to stop recording.  
* `@[char]` <- play the macro  

Vim Filters:

* `:.![cmd]` <- use the current line as stdin for `[cmd]`, stdout on current line  
* `:%! [cmd]` <- use the entire file as stdin for `[cmd]`, stdout on current line
* Pressing `!!` in normal mode will automatically start a filter command
  for the current line (`:.!`)

`<C-o>p` <- quickly pastes register while in insert mode  
`:h i_ctrl-o`
