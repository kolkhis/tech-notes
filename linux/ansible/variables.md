# Variables in Ansible

Ansible supports the use of variables.  

You can define your own variables, and use built-in special variables.

## Variables with Roles
Specify variables to use inside roles in the `role-name/vars/main.yml` file.  

When defining variables inside a role (`roles/role_name/vars/main.yml`), those
variables will **only** be available inside the role itself. They will not be
accesible in a playbook that calls that roll.

```yaml
# roles/role-name/vars/main.yml
my_var: "This is the value of the variable"
some_number: 2
```

## Host Variables
You can assign variables to specific hosts inside the inventory file.  
Using `ini` format:
```ini
[servers]
host1 ansible_host=192.168.4.44 host_specific_variable="This will be available to host1"
host1 ansible_host=192.168.4.45 host_specific_variable="This will be available to host2"
```

Using `yaml` format:
```yml
servers:
  hosts:
    host1:
      ansible_host: 192.168.4.44
      host_specific_variable: "This will be available for host1"
    host1:
      ansible_host: 192.168.4.44
      host_specific_variable: "This will be available for host1"
```


## Builtin Ansible Variables
Ansible has a number of builtin variables that you can use.  


### Ansible Facts (`ansible_facts`)
Ansible has a builtin "facts" variable (`ansible_facts`) that gathers information about the remote
systems it runs on.  
These facts are available to use in playbooks.  

You can set facts for ansible in `/etc/ansible/facts.d`.  

It's a dictionary, and can be accessed like any other variable.  
```yaml
- name: View the contents of ansible_facts
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    var: ansible_facts
```

Using `ansible_facts['env']`, you can access the environment variables on the remote
system. 
E.g.,
```yaml
- name: Show the environment variables on the remote system
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    var: ansible_facts['env']['PS1']
```

### Hostvars (`hostvars`)

This is different from `ansible_facts`, which is a dictionary of facts about the
**current** host.  

Ansible keeps information collected on **all** hosts throughout a playbook in `hostvars`.  
Any variables that are defined within tasks run on those hosts are stored in `hostvars`.  

```yaml
- name: View the contents of hostvars
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    var: hostvars
```

---
#### Accessing `hostvars` for a given host:
Use `hostvars['host-name']` to access the variables for any host in the inventory.  
You can use dot notation to access any of its variables.  
```bash
hostvars['host1'].ansible_host  # The IP address of host1
hostvars['host1'].ansible_user  # The username used on host1
hostvars['host1'].some_output.stdout  # Access the output of a `register`ed task on host1
```


### Magic Variables
These are variables that Ansible sets itself, and can't be set by the user.  


#### General Execution Context Variables
* `ansible_check_mode`: `true` if running in check mode (dry run).
* `ansible_diff_mode`: `true` if running in diff mode (show changes).
* `ansible_forks`: Number of concurrent processes (`--forks` setting).
* `ansible_verbosity`: Current verbosity level for output.
* `ansible_version`: Dictionary with Ansible version details (keys: `full`, `major`, `minor`, etc.).
* `ansible_config_file`: Path to the Ansible configuration file being used.
* `ansible_playbook_python`: Path to the Python interpreter on the control node.
* `ansible_host`: The name of the current host.  

#### Inventory and Host Context Variables
* `inventory_dir`: Directory of the inventory file where the host was defined.
* `inventory_file`: Filename of the inventory source for the host.
* `inventory_hostname`: Full hostname of the current host.
* `inventory_hostname_short`: Short hostname (up to the first `.`).
    * If `inventory_hostname = "example.com"`, then `inventory_hostname_short = "example"`.
* `group_names`: List of groups the current host belongs to.
    * If `group_names = ["web", "db"]`, the current host is in the `web` and `db` groups.
* `groups`: Dictionary of all inventory groups and their hosts.
* `hostvars`: Dictionary of all hosts and their variables.
    * Get the ip address of a host using the `hostvars['host-name'].ansible_host` variable.  
      ```bash
      hostvars['host-name'].ansible_host
      ```
    * Get any of the variables gathered on that host with:
      ```bash
      hostvars['host-name'].var_name
      ```


#### Playbook/Play Context Variables
* `ansible_play_batch`: Active hosts in the current batch (e.g., limited by `serial`, see [updating in batches](./ansible.md#updating-in-batches-serial)).
* `ansible_play_hosts`: All hosts in the current play (excluding failed/unreachable ones).
* `ansible_play_hosts_all`: All targeted hosts in the play.
* `ansible_play_name`: Name of the current play.
* `ansible_limit`: Value of the `--limit` CLI option (host filtering).


#### Role Context Variables
* `ansible_role_name`: Fully qualified name of the current role (`namespace.collection.role_name`).
* `ansible_role_names`: All roles currently imported in the play.
* `ansible_parent_role_names`: List of parent roles for the current role (most recent first).
* `ansible_parent_role_paths`: Paths of parent roles (matching the order in `ansible_parent_role_names`).
* `role_name`: Name of the current role (deprecated).
* `role_path`: Path to the current roleâ€™s directory.


#### Collection Variable
* `ansible_collection_name`: Name of the collection the task belongs to (`namespace.collection`).


#### Loop Control Variables
* `ansible_index_var`: Variable name for the current index in a loop (if defined via `loop_control.index_var`).
* `ansible_loop`: Dictionary with extended loop details (`loop_control.extended` enabled).
* `ansible_loop_var`: Variable name for the current loop item (`loop_control.loop_var`).


#### Tags Variables
* `ansible_run_tags`: Tags included for the current run (`--tags` CLI option).
    * Running with `--tags=setup`, then `ansible_run_tags = ["setup"]`.
* `ansible_skip_tags`: Tags excluded from the current run (`--skip-tags` CLI option).


### File and Path Variables
* `ansible_search_path`: Current search path for relative files (e.g., templates, tasks).
* `playbook_dir`: Directory of the playbook being executed.


#### Task Utility Variable
* `omit`: Special variable to omit task options (e.g., `home={{ var|default(omit) }}`).


#### Deprecated Variables
* `play_hosts`: Deprecated. Use `ansible_play_batch` instead.
* `role_names`: Deprecated. Use `ansible_play_role_names` instead.
