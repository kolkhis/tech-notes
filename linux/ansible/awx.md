# AWX

AWX is an open-source project that provides a web UI for Ansible automation. 
AWX also provides a REST API that can be accessed programmatically.

It is considered a free and open-source alternative to Ansible Automation Platform
(AAP) which is a paid software from RedHat. In fact, AAP is downstream from the AWX
project.  


## Getting Started

Typically, AWX is installed within a Kuberenetes cluster.  

Previously, it was a viable option to use Docker-compose rather than k8s, but 
this has been deprecated in favor of Kubernetes.  

This can be done with k3s instead of full blown Kubernetes.
