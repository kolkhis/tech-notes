# strftime - Datetime Formatting on Linux


## Formatting Dates and Times
Formatting datetime on Linux uses mostly the same format as 
Python's `strftime` function.  

This uses format specifiers starting with a percent sign `%`.  
Each one represents a specific way to output a part of the date
or time.  


## Format Specifiers
Some of these specifiers are zero-padded.  
If they don't have non-zero-padded alts, try `%-X` where `X` is the original
specifier.  
E.g.:
```python
strftime(format='%-m')
# 03
strftime(format='%-m')
# 3
```
