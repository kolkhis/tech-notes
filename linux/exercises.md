    - System resource usage
        - `sar` logs
        - `iostat`
        - `iostat -xz`?
        - `df -h`
        - `du -h`?
        - `free -h`
    - System information
        - `cat /proc/meminfo`
        - `cat /proc/cmdline`

Connect to another server and test for an open port.

```

Test if DNS is working.
